I was waiting for this moment. And here I am. A fresh new member of a [growing] club. The shiny red folding bike pictured above is now mine!</p>
<p>Bromptons are spreading through their owners's friends. This was indeed my case. After only a few seconds of riding my roomate's bike, I knew that I was going to own one. I was not able not to. As an engineer, I love fine pieces of equipement and engineering. The bike is amazing and the quality of the build is delightful. To understand my words, please take one moment to watch this <a target="_blank" href="http://brompton.com/pages/9035">mandatory video: The Fold</a>.</p>
<p>These days, Bromptons are seen everywhere in Lille. They are way more easily seen here than in Paris. I wonder if there is a correlation with the fact that we are closer to London.</p>
<p>This bike is a very welcome upgrade on my weekly train ride to Paris. The VLille (bike sharing network) is unreliable and I had to leave my house 15 minutes earlier each morning. As the stations are usually empty when the Paris train arrive in the evening, I was quite often walking back home.</p>
<p>+15 minutes of sleep in the morning, arriving +15 minutes earlier at work, leaving work +15 minutes later and arriving home +15 minutes earlier. Success. This last few weeks, I really did enjoy my fresh 30 minutes of work and 30 minutes of leasure time.</p>
<p>Did I mention that folded bikes are quite welcome in the French High Speed Trains (TGV)? The Brompton being as incredible as a Brompton, there is always some room left for your bike in trains. Mostly because a folded Brompton can be stored everywhere, including the overhead luggage racks.</p>
<p>The comfort of the bike itself is really hard to describe. People expect something uncomfortable because of the smaller tires, but this is not the case. However, on rugged or paved roads, you will feel the lack of suspension if you are a frequent Amsterdam-type bikes rider.</p>
<p>If you are looking for an efficient folding bike for your daily commute, I would suggest that you try a Brompton. But beware -- the brand is quite expensive.</p>]]>

        <![CDATA[<p>Lately, I have been going through my directories of pictures. 10 years later, digital photography is still a mess when it comes to the storage part. Especially if you try to keep the future in mind.</p>
<p>I have yet to find a safe and cross-platform option to store my files. But this will be another story.</p>
<p>I would like to share with you a small story on how I came to My Best Picture Ever and how my photographic endeavors stopped.</p>
<h3>How everything began</h3>
<p>Like lots of little boys in western countries, I found my first camera in my grandparents basement. This was probably around 1990. My grandfather bought me my first roll of 35mm film and I took my first pictures in a sunny field during the summer.</p>
<p>I remember trying to find a correct opening and exposure time by reading the instructions on the back of the film's package. It took time, lots of time and of course, every picture was a mess. If I was able to get some exposure on the printed pictures, the post processing had probably more credit to it than me.</p>
<p>I also took a black and white photography class in my early years of high school. Being able to discover and experience the chemical processes was a great experience. Unfortunately for me, my parents where strong enough to not let me build my own lab in the basement.</p>
<p>I owned various cameras until I had enough money buy a Canon 350D (or Digital Rebel XT in North America). This was my first digital reflex camera and this is where everything started. I was free of the costs of film and processing and the digital world gave me enough freedom to experiment. Photography got me at this moment.</p>
<h3>And then...</h3>
<p>While studying in Paris, I started attending more and more live music gigs. This was more or less the times where I did buy this Canon reflex. I felt that I had to bring my camera with me. At this time, I had only the kit lens, a 18-55mm zoom, not suitable at all for the obscurity of the places that I was visiting. My pictures were not good, to say the least. But I loved the atmosphere. I loved how the lights where changing so much and so often. I was in love with the complexity and randomness of everything.</p>
<p>The social part was also quite nice. And I enjoyed keeping in touch with the bands, to share pictures and memories of their performances.</p>
<p>At some point I randomly took a few pictures of parisian all-girl rock band. Those pictures have been bought by a paper magazine and this did help me to enter the world of commercial photography. I joined a small agency specialized on music photography and I started contributing to a great webzine, <a href="http://www.lecargo.org">LeCargo</a>.</p>
<div align="center"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/madflo/59760809/" title="Plastiscine - Live au batofar - November 4th, 2005 by madflo, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm1.staticflickr.com/31/59760809_ec385605a0.jpg" alt="Plastiscine - Live au batofar - November 4th, 2005" height="398" width="500" /></a></div>
<p>During the summer of 2005, I was fortunate enough to get an invitation to the Rock en Seine festival -- staring the Pixies, Franz Ferdinand, the Foo Fighters, Arcade Fire, Vitalic, Queen of the Stone Age, I am not sure that they got a better lineup after that. I got the invitation through a great man, whose greatness was only improved when he let me use his boss's Canon EF 70-200 2.8L lens for the whole weekend. No questions asked.</p>
<p>This is where my love for concert photography really started. Thank you Asega!</p>
<div align="center"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/search/?q=rock%20en%20seine&amp;ss=2&amp;ct=0&amp;mt=all&amp;w=92563959%40N00&amp;adv=1" title="Rock en Seine / Vitalic / Pleased Crowd by madflo, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm1.staticflickr.com/29/54121970_117fd3edf9.jpg" alt="Rock en Seine / Vitalic / Pleased Crowd" height="500" width="329" /></a></div>
<p>Even if my pictures of this first festival where not that good, I enjoyed being on the field. I loved running among the other photographers to be in the right place at the right time. And I even had the opportunity of being in a very special place during the Queen of the Stone Age set. This is not an experience that can be described with words.</p>
<h3>Anyway.</h3>
<p>After this great revelation, I attended lots of small gigs and I performed live photography in Paris. Thanks to my small portfolio, I got a few photo pass and was able to attend various music festivals in Brittany. With those experiences, I was connected enough to be invited as a photographer for the Hellfest festival in Clisson in 2007. At this point, selling my pictures did pay for a Canon 24-70mm 2.8L lens. I was able to complete my equipment by renting a 80-200, for much more money that it was worth.</p>
<p>Man, I had the time of my life during the Hellfest. Even with heavy rains and more mud than grass, there is no place like a metal festival. People are true to themselves, living their dream. This is where you can easily catch with the best expressions on faces, on stage or in the crowd.</p>
<p>I took lots of great pictures. But this particular story is about My Best Picture Ever. This picture.</p>
<div align="center"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/madflo/633348304/" title="Kreator Hellfest by madflo, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm2.staticflickr.com/1187/633348304_13ad3e1fa0.jpg" alt="Kreator Hellfest" height="500" width="333" /></a></div>
<p>There are lot of things and stories leading to this picture but what I really love about it is the fact that everyone can get the atmosphere. You don't need to know the story. You don't have to have any interest in that particular kind of music to get what is currently happening between the crowd and the guy on stage.</p>
<p>This might is absolutely not the Best Picture Ever. But this is currently mine. I hope that you will enjoy it.</p>
<h3>After that.</h3>
<p>I moved from Paris to Brittany, switched my job, my girlfriend, did an amazing trip between Montreal and San Francisco and landed back in France in Lille -- a great city where I still live. In 2009, on the 26th of December, a burglar did enter my house and every part of my photographic equipment was stolen.</p>
<p>I guess that something is now broken in my hearth and I never had as much fun taking pictures since this very particular moment. I never tried to take a picture near a stage. The green one is still my favorite.</p>
<p>I hope to move on, but I still have to find a camera that really fit my new requirements: easy to travel with and with a great image quality. Something as small as my beloved <a href="https://www.google.fr/search?q=rollei+35">Rollei 35</a>, but digital. And reasonably priced. The search continues.</p>]]>

        <![CDATA[<p>Damnit. I am in a bar, spending some quality time with great people and the conversation is slowing moving to books and music. A topic that I usually fancy. I guess that sharing those souvenirs is easier than sharing old stories and emotions, especially when speaking a foreign language.</p>
<p>I want to contribute to a discussion that I do enjoy. But here it comes again, I forgot the artist or the title of the record that I am thinking of. Encore une fois.</p>
<p>The same thing is happening when I am alone. It is sometimes impossible to listen to the music that I would like to hear. Of course, we are in 2013 and accessing the media is not an issue anymore. In the old times, I used to know where was my CD was stored, even if the name of the artist or the song was gone from my short term memory. And now, even with an infinite source of music (the Internets?), I still have to use some weird connection to find a name.</p>
<p>For example, lets say that I would like to listen to the lovely tune <a href="http://open.spotify.com/track/6oeuEHxwfbqu5xIJrcbPzN">Perth by Bon Iver</a>. My usual path to this particular song is to open my friend Robin's public track list on Spotify and to browse it until I find this one song.</p>
<p>There should be another way. This is also why I am <a href="http://www.lastfm.fr/user/madflo">still in love with last.fm</a>, even after so much time.</p>
<p>Tell me, Mr Internet. Is there a new thing that I am should be aware and that may help me with this first world illness? Thank you.</p>]]>
